## Day 1 - August 8, 2025
**Phase**: Planning & Architecture (Phase 1)
**Focus**: Project initialization and architecture planning

### 🎯 Objectives for Today
- [x] Create comprehensive project documentation
- [x] Set up project structure and planning documents
- [x] Define technical architecture and technology stack
- [x] Initialize development environment setup guide
- [x] Set up Git repository and version control
- [x] Create initial project structure
- [x] Initialize package.json and basic configuration

### ✅ Achievements
1. **Project Documentation Created**
   - `README.md`: Complete project overview and 16-week execution plan
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Technical architecture with database design and API structure
   - `SETUP_GUIDE.md`: Step-by-step development environment setup
   - `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`: Daily progress tracking (this document)

2. **Architecture Decisions Made**
   - **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand for state management
   - **Backend**: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL database, Redis for caching
   - **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control
   - **File Storage**: AWS S3 for image uploads
   - **Payment**: Stripe integration

4. **Project Structure Created**
   ```
   AgroKart/
   ├── frontend/          # React TypeScript app
   ├── backend/           # Node.js Express API
   ├── database/          # SQL migrations and seeds
   ├── docs/              # Documentation
   ├── assets/            # Static assets
   └── deployment/        # Docker, CI/CD configs
   ```

### 📝 Key Decisions
- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL chosen over MongoDB for ACID compliance and complex relationships
- **State Management**: Zustand selected over Redux for simplicity and performance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI for rapid development and consistency
- **Testing Strategy**: Jest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend

### 🔄 Next Steps (Day 2)
- Initialize Git repository
- Create project folder structure
- Set up initial package.json configurations
- Initialize database schema planning
- Begin frontend project setup with Create React App

### ⏱️ Time Spent
- Documentation: 2 hours
- Architecture planning: 1 hour
- Project setup: 1 hour
- Database schema design: 1 hour
- **Total: 5 hours**

4. **Git Repository Initialized**
   - Created .gitignore with comprehensive exclusions
   - Set up folder structure (frontend, backend, database, docs, assets)
   - Initialized main package.json

5. **Database Schema Started**
   - `001_create_users_table.sql`: Multi-role user authentication
   - `002_create_farmer_profiles_table.sql`: Extended farmer information
   - `003_create_categories_table.sql`: Hierarchical product categories
   - Added comprehensive indexing and documentation

### 📚 Learning Notes
- Researched modern React patterns and best practices for 2025
- Explored PostgreSQL array data types for storing multiple images
- Investigated Stripe vs Razorpay for payment processing in agricultural context
- Learned about PostgreSQL ENUM types for role-based systems
- Studied hierarchical data structures in SQL
