## 🌾 What is AgroKart?

### Simple Explanation
Imagine a website like Amazon, but specifically for fresh fruits and vegetables directly from farmers. AgroKart connects:
- **Farmers** who grow produce
- **Customers** who want to buy fresh produce
- **Middlemen** who help manage logistics and sales

### The Problem We're Solving
Currently, when you buy vegetables:
1. Farmer grows tomatoes 🍅
2. Farmer sells to middleman at low price
3. Middleman sells to retailer
4. Retailer sells to you at high price

**Result**: Farmer gets little money, you pay high prices

### Our Solution
With AgroKart:
1. Farmer grows tomatoes 🍅
2. Farmer lists tomatoes on AgroKart
3. You buy directly from farmer

**Result**: Farmer gets fair price, you pay less, fresher produce!

1. **Browse Products**: Look at fresh produce available
2. **See Details**: View farmer info, harvest date, price
3. **Add to Cart**: Select what you want to buy
4. **Pay Online**: Secure payment with credit/debit card
5. **Get Delivery**: Fresh produce delivered to your home

### For Farmers (People who grow)
1. **Register Account**: Sign up as a farmer
2. **Add Products**: Upload photos and details of produce
3. **Set Prices**: Decide how much to charge
4. **Get Orders**: Receive notifications when someone buys
5. **Ship Products**: Send produce to customers
6. **Get Paid**: Receive money directly in bank account

### For Middlemen (Logistics helpers)
1. **Partner with Farmers**: Help multiple farmers sell
2. **Manage Inventory**: Handle storage and distribution
3. **Bulk Operations**: Process large quantities

## ⚙️ Backend Explained

The backend is like the engine of a car - you don't see it, but it makes everything work.

### API Endpoints (Communication Points) 📡
Think of these as different service counters at a bank:

#### Authentication Counter 🔐
- `/api/auth/register` - Open new account
- `/api/auth/login` - Sign in to account
- `/api/auth/logout` - Sign out
- `/api/auth/refresh` - Renew session

#### Products Counter 🥬
- `GET /api/products` - Show all products
- `POST /api/products` - Add new product (farmers only)
- `PUT /api/products/:id` - Update product (owner only)
- `DELETE /api/products/:id` - Remove product (owner only)

#### Orders Counter 📦
- `GET /api/orders` - Show my orders
- `POST /api/orders` - Place new order
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/status` - Update order status

#### Users Counter 👤
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get my profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update my profile

### Middleware (Security Guards) 🛡️
**What they do:** Check permissions before allowing actions

1. **Authentication Middleware**
   - Checks if user is logged in
   - Verifies user identity
   - Like: Security guard checking ID cards

2. **Authorization Middleware**
   - Checks if user has permission for action
   - Like: Bouncer checking VIP list

3. **Validation Middleware**
   - Ensures data is correct format
   - Like: Form checker ensuring all fields filled

### Services (Helper Functions) 🔧
**What they do:** Handle complex business logic

1. **Email Service**
   - Sends confirmation emails
   - Password reset emails
   - Order notifications

2. **Payment Service**
   - Processes credit card payments
   - Handles refunds
   - Manages transactions

3. **File Upload Service**
   - Handles photo uploads
   - Resizes images
   - Stores in cloud storage

---

## 🔐 Authentication System

Authentication is like the ID card system for the platform.

### How It Works (Step by Step)

#### 1. User Registration 📝
```
User enters:
- Email address
- Password
- Name and details
- Role (customer/farmer/middleman)

System does:
1. Checks if email already exists
2. Encrypts password (makes it unreadable)
3. Sends verification email
4. Creates account once verified
```

#### 2. User Login 🔑
```
User enters:
- Email
- Password

System does:
1. Finds user by email
2. Compares encrypted password
3. If correct, creates JWT token
4. Sends token to user's browser
```

#### 3. JWT Tokens (Digital ID Cards) 🎫
**What is JWT?** JSON Web Token - like a digital ID card

**What it contains:**
- User ID
- User role (customer/farmer/middleman)
- Expiration time
- Security signature

**How it works:**
- Browser stores token
- Sends token with every request
- Server verifies token
- If valid, allows action

#### 4. Role-Based Access 👮‍♂️
**What it means:** Different users can do different things

**Customer can:**
- Browse products ✅
- Place orders ✅
- Write reviews ✅
- Add products ❌

**Farmer can:**
- Browse products ✅
- Add own products ✅
- View own orders ✅
- See all user data ❌

**Admin can:**
- Everything ✅

## 📸 File Upload System

Handles uploading and storing product photos.

### How Photo Upload Works

#### 1. User Selects Photos 🖼️
```
Frontend:
- User clicks "Add Photos" button
- File picker opens
- User selects image files
- Frontend validates files (size, type)
```

#### 2. Upload Process 📤
```
Backend receives:
- Image files
- Product information
- User authentication

Backend does:
1. Verifies user permission
2. Checks file size and type
3. Generates unique filename
4. Uploads to AWS S3
5. Returns image URLs
6. Stores URLs in database
```

#### 3. Image Display 🖥️
```
When showing products:
1. Get image URLs from database
2. Browser loads images from S3
3. Display in user interface
```

### Security Measures 🔒
- Only image files allowed
- Maximum file size limit (5MB)
- Unique filenames prevent conflicts
- Secure cloud storage with backup

---

## 💳 Payment System

Handles secure online payments.

### How Payment Works

#### 1. Customer Checkout 🛒
```
Customer:
1. Reviews cart items
2. Enters delivery address
3. Selects payment method
4. Enters credit card details
```

#### 2. Payment Processing 💰
```
System:
1. Sends payment info to Stripe (secure payment processor)
2. Stripe verifies card details
3. If approved, money is held by Stripe
4. Order is created with "pending" status
5. Farmer receives order notification
```

#### 3. Order Fulfillment 📦
```
When farmer ships:
1. Updates order to "shipped"
2. When delivered, status becomes "completed"
3. Stripe releases money to farmer's account
4. Platform takes small commission
```

### Security Features 🛡️
- Credit card info never stored on our servers
- PCI DSS compliant payment processing
- Encrypted data transmission
- Fraud detection built-in
