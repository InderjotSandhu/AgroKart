# AgroKart – Direct Farm-to-Customer E-Commerce Platform

## 🌾 Project Overview

AgroKart is a revolutionary dual-mode e-commerce platform designed to bridge the gap between farmers, middlemen, and consumers by eliminating inefficiencies in the agricultural supply chain. The platform promotes transparency, fair pricing, and direct access to farm-fresh produce.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- **For Farmers**: Limited market access, dependency on middlemen, reduced profit margins
- **For Consumers**: High prices, lack of transparency about produce origin, limited access to farm-fresh goods
- **For Supply Chain**: Food wastage, operational inefficiencies, price inflation due to multiple intermediaries

## 💡 Solution Approach

A comprehensive dual-mode platform that enables:
- Direct farmer-to-consumer sales
- Middleman-facilitated bulk operations
- Transparent pricing and sourcing
- Efficient logistics and inventory management
